              I am working as a part of the tech team at Seldon in London,
              United Kingdom, currently. I find myself continuing on my journey
              building products to streamline machine learning deployment
              processes in the complex enterprise ecosystems. At the same time,
              it is great to be part of an open core organisation.

              Lead a tech team at Mu Sigma Labs as a senior software developer
              working on multiple projects for machine learning model
              operationalization, simulations environments and service
              availability. This was a different challenge that I found quite
              enjoyable not only growing as an organised developer but improving
              my leadership skills.

              I was promoted to the role of a Developer to create a new range of
              in-house products that can be leveraged by the data scientists and
              business analysts in the organisations. This involved creating
              data pipelines, monitoring dashboards, control systems and user
              interfaces that assist with the daily machine learning workflows.
              This was an extremely energetic workplace where I build new
              projects, improved my skills, progressed developer and also
              started my very first open source contributions.
